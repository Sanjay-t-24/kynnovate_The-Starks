Time,"Time is the continuous progression of our changing existence that occurs in an apparently irreversible succession from the past, through the present, and into the future. It is a component quantity of various measurements used to sequence events, to compare the duration of events, and to quantify rates of change of quantities in material reality or in the conscious experience. Time is often referred to as a fourth dimension, along with three spatial dimensions. Scientists have theorized a beginning of time in our universe and an end. A cyclic model describes a cyclical nature, whereas the philosophy of eternalism views the subject from a different angle."
